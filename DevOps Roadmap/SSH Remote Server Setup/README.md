# [SSH Remote Server Setup](https://roadmap.sh/projects/ssh-remote-server-setup)
The goal of this project is to learn and practice the basics of Linux. You are required to setup a remote linux server and configure it to allow SSH connections.

## Requirements
- You are required to setup a remote linux server and configure it to allow SSH connections.
- Create two new SSH key pairs and add them to your server.
- You should be able to connect to your server using both SSH keys.
- You should be able to use the following command to connect to your server using both SSH keys.

Stretch goal: Install and configure fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks.

## Solution
1. **Create a Remote Server**
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been used with the Compute Engine free tier:
Create the project and execute following command through Cloud Shell:
```sh
gcloud compute instances create ssh-remote-server \
    --machine-type=e2-micro \
    --zone=us-west1-b \
    --image-family=debian-11 \
    --image-project=debian-cloud \
    --boot-disk-size=10GB \
    --boot-disk-type=pd-standard \
    --tags=ssh-server \
    --address ""
``` 
Update the firewall rules to be able to connect:
```sh
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-ssh \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --priority=1000 \
    --network=default \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=tcp:22 \
    --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
    --target-tags=ssh-server
```
2. **Generate SSH Key Pairs**:
On your local machine, generate an SSH key pair to use for secure access to the server.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Name the key files (id_rsa or a custom name).
- This will create two files: a private key (id_rsa) and a public key (id_rsa.pub).
  
3. **Add the SSH Key to the Server**
Use the following command to update the metadata on the instance with the SSH key:

```sh
gcloud compute instances add-metadata ssh-remote-server \
    --zone=us-west1-b \
    --metadata-from-file=ssh-keys=id_rsa.pub
```

If you want to add two keys, just replace id_rsa.pub with another concatenated file

```sh
echo "user1:$(cat ~/.ssh/user1_key.pub)" > ssh-keys.txt
echo "user2:$(cat ~/.ssh/user2_key.pub)" >> ssh-keys.txt
```

And then update the metadata with both keys info:
```sh
gcloud compute instances add-metadata ssh-remote-server \
    --zone=us-west1-b \
    --metadata-from-file=ssh-keys=ssh-keys.txt
```

4. **Configure SSH Access on Your Local Machine**
To simplify connecting to your server, edit the SSH configuration file on your local machine:

```sh
vi ~/.ssh/config
```
Add the following lines to the config file:

```sh
Host myserver
    HostName server-ip
    User user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
- Replace myserver with an alias you want to use for this server.
- Replace server-ip with your serverâ€™s IP address.
- Replace user with your server's username.
  
5. **Test SSH Connection**
Test the SSH connection using the alias you set up:

```sh
ssh myserver
```

6. **Install Fail2ban for Security**

Install Fail2ban:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban
```
Configure Fail2ban to protect SSH by editing the configuration file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
Add the following:

```sh
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 600
findtime = 600
```

Restart the Fail2ban service:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```
